# Iago: An Othello Player

This project is an Othello player written in Java. The main goals of this project are to follow good software development practices and write clean code. Making a decent Othello AI wouldn't hurt, though.

## Usage

Clone this repository and run `./gradlew build`. This project is still a work in progress, so it'll be a bit before anything actually works.

## The Name

Why the name `iago`, though? I named it after the bird, obviously.

Just kidding -- I love *Aladdin*, but I actually named this after Iago, the villain in Shakespeare's *Othello*, because, well... the play and the game share a name. That's basically it.
